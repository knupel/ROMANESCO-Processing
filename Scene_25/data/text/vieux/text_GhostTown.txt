This town, is coming like a ghost town /// All the clubs have been closed down /// This place, is coming like a ghost town /// Bands won't play no more
too much fighting on the dance floor

Do you remember the good old days /// Before the ghost town? ///We danced and sang, /// And the music played inna de boomtown

This town, is coming like a ghost town /// Why must the youth fight against themselves? /// Government leaving the youth on the shelf /// This place, is coming like a ghost town /// No job to be found in this country
Can't go on no more ///The people getting angry

This town, is coming like a ghost town
This town, is coming like a ghost town
This town, is coming like a ghost town
This town, is coming like a ghost town
